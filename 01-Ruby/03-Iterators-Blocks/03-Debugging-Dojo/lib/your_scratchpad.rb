# The tests don't check this file at all
# It's just here to give you a place to play with the code
# Feel free to modify it as you see fit

# For instance, if you want to see the error for the first method,
# write something like

# puts double_number(10)

# and run `ruby lib/your_scratchpad.rb` on your terminal and see if you get any error or a value!
