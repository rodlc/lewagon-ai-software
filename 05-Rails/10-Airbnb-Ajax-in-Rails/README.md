## AI Week - Final demos

At this stage you should have a fully functioning AI Assistant, ready to showcase by the end of the session. You may have ideas of use cases of Tools you wish to add, to introduce an agentic behaviour in your app, that said it might be ambitious or uncertain for this week's demo. You will have more time during projects weeks to explore them, be patient.

Instead, you may want to focus on implementing the **streaming behaviour** with ActionCable and the Turbo Stream broadcasting of LLM answers chunks, to improve the User Experience when they interact with the LLM!

Some details about what is expected of you during your demos:
1. 5 minutes per group
2. 1 speaker / 1 assistant
3. Start from the problem and show us a user path through a realistic and entertaining example
4. Do not make a display of the different coded features, we want to see a use-case!
5. No signup during the demo - one should not be bored for 1 second!
