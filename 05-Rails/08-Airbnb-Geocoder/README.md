## AI Week - Intermediate Demos

At this point, you should have users and a first functioning feature using an LLM API, with a working system prompt.

As seen during the lecture, you can now **process files** and setup ActiveStorage with Cloudinary to do so.

Make sure to use the right model depending on the file content type, and to add the appropriate **validations** in your code to avoid processing too large files, to control your API consumption.

Also, as seen during the second lecture, you can refine your frontend and add **interactive behaviour in your UI** with JavaScript, implementing it with simple Stimulus controllers.

Last, don't forget to prepare your **intermediate demo**: freeze deployments at mid-session and focus on testing your user journey until it's perfect. All demos must be done in production, no localhost allowed. Make sure you prepare the production environment with well-thought [seeds](https://kitt.lewagon.com/knowledge/cheatsheets/rails_seeds).
